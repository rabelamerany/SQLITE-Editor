SqliteEditor is an Android application for SQLITE database management. Our goal is to create an application that will help users within a company; the goal is to provide them with an interface allowing basic manipulation of databases. The main functions of this application are: the creation of objects (databases, tables, lines), the deletion of objects (lines, tables) in addition to an authentication layer allowing to distinguish between two types of users (Administrator and normal user).

<b>How the app works</b>

Our application is based on internal databases allowing the storage of users, and tables created. The start interface includes a connection form allowing each user authentication to access the view dedicated to him. There are two types of view depending on the type of user: "Administrator" or "User".

The "Administrator" view allows the management and search of users with an account on the application, while the "User" view allows through an interface the creation of databases, tables, the execution of SQL queries and the database export.
